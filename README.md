# Time-Series-analysis-using-python
In this project, both additive and multiplicative models are utilized to dissect time series data. Additive models decompose time series into components like trend, seasonality, and residual effects, treating them as independent factors. Multiplicative models, on the other hand, allow these components to interact multiplicatively,
